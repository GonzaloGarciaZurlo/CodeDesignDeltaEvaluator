# CodeDesignDeltaEvaluator
In object-oriented software development, particularly in agile or open-source environments, it is common for system architecture to evolve without explicit planning. This phenomenon, known as emergent design, can lead to architectural degradation and long-term maintainability issues. This thesis introduces CodeDesignCheck, a tool designed to automatically control structural changes in the design of a system by comparing two versions of a repository: the main branch and a pull request.
The tool models the design of each version as a directed graph, where classes, methods, and packages are represented as nodes, and their relationships (such as inheritance, composition, or dependency) as labeled edges. These graphs are generated from UML diagrams obtained through reverse engineering and stored in a graph database, where they can be queried using the Cypher language.
Based on these models, CodeDesignCheck computes a set of structural and differential metrics that quantify the impact of the proposed change. When the differences exceed configurable thresholds, the tool can either warn the developer or automatically reject the pull request, thus promoting architectural stability over time.
The tool is designed to run from the command line or as part of a continuous integration pipeline, and it can be adapted to different programming languages, provided a compatible UML generation tool is available. This thesis lays the conceptual and technical foundation for this approach and presents an initial implementation of the tool with the potential to be used in real-world collaborative development environments.
