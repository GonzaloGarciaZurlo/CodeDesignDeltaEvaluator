# Deciding which library to use for parsing

## Context and Problem Statement

Which package dependency manager to use for the project.

## Considered Options

* Poetry
* UV

## Decision Outcome

Poetry is a currently consolidated tool for managing project dependencies. It is a tool well known by colleagues, which is a great advantage over UV.

UV is a tool with more future than poetry, due to the innovations it provides.

Chosen option: Poetry mainly due to the help that people around me can give me with this tool
